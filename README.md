My first website for my work. (Code might be a huge mess, I'm working on it)


Hey there, this is the first serios step into web-developing and coding by myself.
Since I need a Website I toke this as an opportunity to get into coding, so don't hesitate to optimize my code.
I'm completely new to all of this. 
One day I'll be looking back and laught about this stuff, because it's so messy, but you have to start somewhere.
So here I am.
Let's build a sweet looking website.
